# Batch Rendering
An OpenGL example of Batch Rendering.

## Usage

Currently only "officially" supports Windows - Mac and Linux support is coming soon.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/satvik-tiwari/BatchRendering.git
```

Run `scripts/Win-Premake.bat` and open `OpenGL-Sandbox.sln` in Visual Studio 2019. `OpenGL-Sandbox/src/SandboxLayer.cpp` contains the example OpenGL Batch-Rendering code that's running.
